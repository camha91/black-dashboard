                October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and
                into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a
                sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup
                potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at
                the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had
                been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The
                steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that
                her whole head was on fire.
